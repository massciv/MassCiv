Lift Off

-making an addition-

damn, it's tough to get into the editing page. 
why do they make that so difficult. Is this the only screen where edits can be made?
can anyone jump into any branch and make a change to anything?
or do you have to fork it and own your own version?

seems easy to add a comment to something.
